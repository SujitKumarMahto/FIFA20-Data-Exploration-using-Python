# FIFA20 Data Exploration using Python

This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Certificate (Coursera - Guided Project)**, where I explored and visualized FIFA20 player data using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on FIFA20 player data and gain meaningful insights. The dataset includes detailed information about players in the FIFA20 video game.

### âœ… Key Steps

1. **Imported FIFA20 datasets (5 CSVs)**
2. **Cleaned and preprocessed data**:
   - Removed irrelevant columns
   - Handled missing values
   - Created new features
3. **Performed feature engineering** for better insights
4. **Created visualizations**:
   - Scatter plots (Overall Rating vs Age, Price)
   - Pie charts (Right-footed vs Left-footed players)
   - Polar charts (Player growth over time)
5. **Built a player recommender function** based on position and value
